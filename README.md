# Tracking Rectangles in Real Time

Iterating on Apple's [Tracking the User's Face in Real Time](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/tracking_the_user_s_face_in_real_time) demo project to instead track Rectangles in real time.

## Next Steps

* Capture Image
* Save Image to Camera Roll
* Crop image to detected rectangle bounding box
* Send Image to Photo Service

## Current bugs

* Rectangles not being drawn at right FPS
* Rectangle path not "pretty"
* Rectangles not drawn when finger on corner
